## Strategic Reasoning

### Why Not All 50 for Local SEO?

**Pros of Limiting to 15:**
1. ✅ **Focus on High-Value**: Target conditions with highest search volume
2. ✅ **Quality over Quantity**: Better content for each page
3. ✅ **Manageable**: 960 pages is already substantial
4. ✅ **Conversion-Focused**: These 15 drive most appointments
5. ✅ **Resource Efficient**: Easier to maintain and optimize

**If We Used All 50:**
- Would create 50 × 64 = **3,200 location pages**
- Many would be low search volume
- Harder to maintain quality
- Risk of thin content penalties
- Lower ROI on effort

### Future Expansion Potential

**Phase 2** (if results warrant):
- Add 10-15 more high-performing conditions
- Would create 640-960 additional pages
- Focus on conditions showing demand
- Data-driven expansion based on analytics
