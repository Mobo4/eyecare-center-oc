Are You Tired of Relying on Eye Drops That Don't Work?

**Body Copy:**
If you suffer from burning, itching, redness, or a "sand in the eye" sensation, you know how frustrating it can be. Artificial tears only provide temporary relief because they don't fix the underlying problem.

**The Reality:**
86% of dry eye cases are caused by **Meibomian Gland Dysfunction (MGD)**—blocked oil glands in your eyelids that cause your tears to evaporate too quickly.
