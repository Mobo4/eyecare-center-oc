## 2. Problem & Agitation

**Header:**
Don't Navigate Your Surgery Alone.

**Body Copy:**
Deciding to have eye surgery is a big life event. With so many options (LASIK, PRK, SMILE, ICL, Premium Cataract Lenses) and so many surgeons advertising "best prices," it’s easy to feel overwhelmed.

**The Risk:**
Going directly to a high-volume surgical center can sometimes feel like a sales pitch. You need to know: Is this procedure actually right for *me*? Is there a better option?
