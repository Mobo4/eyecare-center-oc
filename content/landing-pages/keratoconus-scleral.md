## 2. Problem & Agitation

**Header:**
Struggling with Blurry, Distorted Vision?

**Body Copy:**
Living with keratoconus can be frustrating. Glasses often don't provide clear vision, and standard contact lenses may pop out or feel uncomfortable. You might feel like you're running out of options.

**The Reality:**
Keratoconus causes your cornea to bulge, creating irregular astigmatism that standard lenses can't correct. You need a solution designed for *your* unique eye shape.

## 3. The Solution: Scleral Lenses

**Header:**
The Gold Standard for Keratoconus: Scleral Lenses

**Body Copy:**
Scleral lenses are large-diameter gas permeable lenses that vault over the entire cornea and rest gently on the white part of the eye (the sclera). This creates a smooth optical surface that masks irregularities, providing **high-definition vision** that glasses simply cannot match.

**Why They Work:**
*   **Superior Comfort:** They don't touch the sensitive cornea.
*   **Stable Vision:** The lens stays centered and doesn't rotate.
*   **Hydration:** A reservoir of fluid keeps your eye moist all day.

## 7. FAQ Section

**Q: Are scleral lenses hard to put in?**
A: There is a learning curve, but we provide extensive training. Most patients master it within a week and find it becomes second nature.

**Q: Will my insurance cover them?**
A: Many vision plans classify scleral lenses as "medically necessary" for keratoconus, which may cover a significant portion of the cost. We can help verify your benefits.

**Q: Can I wear them all day?**
A: Yes! Because they vault over the cornea and hold fluid, they are often more comfortable than standard lenses for all-day wear.
