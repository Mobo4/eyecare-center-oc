Get to the Root Cause of Your Pain

**Body Copy:**
Standard eye exams check for 20/20 vision, but they often miss how your eyes *work together*. At EyeCare Center of OC, we test for **Binocular Vision Dysfunction (BVD)** and digital strain.

**Our Solutions:**
*   **Neurolens® / Prism Lenses:** Specialized lenses that correct misalignment, relaxing your eye muscles and preventing overstimulation of the trigeminal nerve (a major cause of headaches).
*   **Blue Light Filtration:** Advanced coatings to reduce glare and high-energy light.
*   **Ergonomic Vision Therapy:** Exercises to strengthen your focusing system.

## 7. FAQ Section

**Q: I have 20/20 vision. Do I still need this?**
A: Yes! You can have perfect clarity but still have poor eye alignment, which causes your eye muscles to overwork and leads to pain.

**Q: What are Neurolenses?**
A: They are the first and only prescription lenses that add a contoured prism to bring the eyes into alignment, relieving the stress on the trigeminal nerve.

**Q: Will I need to wear glasses all the time?**
A: It depends on your specific case. Many patients only wear them while working on computers, while others find relief wearing them all day.
