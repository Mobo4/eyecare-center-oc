## DISPUTE SUMMARY

I am formally disputing charges from Semrush Inc. on my Capital One credit card. I am requesting a full chargeback under the Fair Credit Billing Act (15 U.S.C. § 1666) and California's Automatic Renewal Law (Business & Professions Code § 17600-17606).

Please review the attached email correspondence for specific dates, amounts, and my documented attempts to resolve this matter directly with the merchant.

## GROUNDS FOR DISPUTE

### 1. Violation of California Automatic Renewal Law (B&P Code § 17602)

California law requires that businesses offering automatic renewals must:

**a) Provide Clear and Conspicuous Disclosure**
> The automatic renewal terms must be presented "in a clear and conspicuous manner before the subscription or purchasing agreement is fulfilled."

**SEMrush violated this requirement.** The auto-renewal terms were not clearly disclosed at the time of purchase. Hidden or buried terms in lengthy Terms of Service do not constitute "clear and conspicuous" disclosure under California law.

**b) Obtain Affirmative Consent**
> The business must obtain the consumer's "affirmative consent to the agreement containing the automatic renewal offer terms."

**SEMrush failed to obtain proper affirmative consent.** Pre-checked boxes or passive acceptance does not constitute affirmative consent.

**c) Provide Acknowledgment**
> The business must provide an acknowledgment that includes the automatic renewal terms, cancellation policy, and information on how to cancel.

**SEMrush failed to provide adequate acknowledgment** of these terms in a manner I could easily review before being charged.

**d) Provide Easy Cancellation**
> California law requires a "cost-effective, timely, and easy-to-use mechanism for cancellation."

**SEMrush made cancellation unreasonably difficult.** As documented in my attached emails, my cancellation requests were ignored, delayed, or required jumping through unnecessary hoops.

### 2. Services Not Rendered / Not as Described

I paid for services that were:
- Not delivered as advertised
- Not accessible as promised
- Not providing the value represented at purchase

The attached emails document my attempts to resolve service issues directly with SEMrush, which were unsuccessful.

### 3. Failure to Process Refund Request

Despite submitting refund requests as documented in the attached emails, SEMrush:
- Failed to respond in a timely manner
- Refused to honor refund requests
- Cited policies that violate California consumer protection law

### 4. Unauthorized Charge / Auto-Renewal Without Proper Notice

The disputed charge was an automatic renewal that was processed:
- Without adequate prior notice
- Without clear disclosure at original purchase
- Without my explicit authorization for renewal
- After I had attempted to cancel (see attached emails)

## CALIFORNIA LAW VIOLATIONS (Detailed)

### Business & Professions Code § 17602

This law specifically states:

> "It is unlawful for any business making an automatic renewal or continuous service offer to a consumer in this state to... fail to present the automatic renewal offer terms or continuous service offer terms in a clear and conspicuous manner before the subscription or purchasing agreement is fulfilled and in visual proximity to the request for consent to the offer."

### Penalties Under California Law

Violations of this law:
- Render the automatic renewal **VOID AND UNENFORCEABLE**
- Entitle the consumer to a **FULL REFUND**
- May constitute an **UNFAIR BUSINESS PRACTICE** under B&P Code § 17200

### FTC Guidelines on Negative Option Marketing

The Federal Trade Commission has issued guidance that automatic renewal programs must:
- Clearly disclose all material terms
- Obtain express informed consent
- Provide simple cancellation methods
- Send renewal reminders before charging

SEMrush's practices fail to meet these federal standards.
