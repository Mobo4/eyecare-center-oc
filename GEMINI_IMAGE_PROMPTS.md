## 🎯 **GENERATION PRIORITY ORDER:**

### **Phase 1 - Immediate (Today):**
1. ✅ **Trust Badge Icons (Set 2)** - Fastest to generate, immediate impact
2. ✅ **Service Category Icons (Set 3)** - Critical for homepage services

### **Phase 2 - This Week:**
3. ⭐ **Hero Background (Set 1)** - Large file, may need iteration
4. 🎨 **Glassmorphism Backgrounds (Set 4)** - Enhancement layer

### **Phase 3 - Next Week:**
5. 📱 **Mobile Icons (Set 5)** - Mobile optimization phase

---

## 💡 **PRO TIPS FOR GEMINI GENERATION:**

### **Best Practices:**
1. **Generate trust badges first** - Quick wins, instant visual impact
2. **Request all 6 service icons together** - Ensures visual consistency
3. **Ask for 2 variations** - Pick the best, have backup options
4. **Specify exact colors** - Use hex codes from prompts above
5. **Request SVG when possible** - Scalable, smaller file size

### **If First Generation Isn't Perfect:**
```
Refine prompt with:
"Make it more [professional/modern/minimal/warm]"
"Reduce complexity, simpler lines"
"Stronger contrast between elements"
"More medical authority / More wellness warmth"
```

### **Format Conversion:**
- If Gemini gives PNG, that's fine for trust badges
- For service icons, prefer SVG or request PNG at 2x size (128x128px)
- Optimize all images: https://squoosh.app or ImageOptim
