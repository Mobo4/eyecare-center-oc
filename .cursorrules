# Cursor AI - Task Allocation Rules

## 🎯 PRIMARY DIRECTIVE: TOKEN EFFICIENCY

**CRITICAL:** Cursor uses API tokens. Claude Code has unlimited context. Defer token-intensive work to Claude Code.

## ✅ CURSOR SHOULD HANDLE (Simple, Quick Tasks)

### Quick Edits (< 50 tokens)
- Fix typos and formatting
- Update single values (colors, numbers, strings)
- Add/remove simple comments
- Rename variables or functions
- Quick CSS tweaks
- Simple copy changes

### Small Code Changes (< 200 tokens)
- Add a single prop to a component
- Update a single function parameter
- Fix simple syntax errors
- Add simple error handling
- Update import statements
- Add basic type annotations

### File Operations
- Create new files from templates
- Delete unused files
- Rename files
- Move files between directories

### Navigation & Search
- Find files by name
- Jump to definitions
- Quick symbol searches
- File tree navigation

## ❌ DEFER TO CLAUDE CODE (Token-Intensive Tasks)

### Complex Analysis
- Multi-file debugging
- Codebase-wide searches
- Performance optimization
- Security audits
- Architectural reviews
- Dependencies analysis

### Large Implementations
- New feature development
- Multi-component systems
- API integrations
- Database schema changes
- Complex state management
- Full page implementations

### Refactoring
- Large-scale code refactoring
- Breaking down monolithic files
- Extracting shared logic
- Updating patterns across multiple files

### Documentation & Planning
- Creating comprehensive documentation
- Writing technical specifications
- Planning implementation strategies
- Creating migration guides

### Testing
- Writing test suites
- Integration testing
- E2E test scenarios
- Test coverage analysis

### Debugging
- Complex bug investigation
- Multi-step debugging
- Root cause analysis
- Performance profiling

## 📋 DECISION MATRIX

| Task Type | Cursor | Claude Code |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Fix typo | ✅ | |
| Add prop | ✅ | |
| Rename file | ✅ | |
| Update color | ✅ | |
| Simple CSS | ✅ | |
| Debug complex issue | | ✅ |
| New feature | | ✅ |
| Multi-file refactor | | ✅ |
| Write tests | | ✅ |
| API integration | | ✅ |
| Performance optimization | | ✅ |
| Codebase analysis | | ✅ |
| Documentation | | ✅ |

## 🤝 COLLABORATION PATTERN

When user requests something that's borderline:

**Cursor Response:**
```
"This task involves [complexity]. For token efficiency, I recommend:
- Using Claude Code for the main implementation
- I can help with quick follow-up edits

Would you like me to pass this to Claude Code?"
```

## 💡 EXAMPLES

### ✅ GOOD - Cursor Handles
```
User: "Change the button color from blue to green"
Cursor: [Makes the change directly - simple value update]
```

```
User: "Fix the typo in the header"
Cursor: [Fixes typo - simple edit]
```

```
User: "Add a margin-top to this div"
Cursor: [Adds the style - simple CSS change]
```

### ❌ DEFER - Claude Code Handles
```
User: "Debug why the form isn't submitting"
Cursor: "This requires multi-step debugging across components.
For token efficiency, I recommend using Claude Code for this analysis."
```

```
User: "Implement the new appointment booking feature"
Cursor: "This is a complex feature requiring multiple components
and API integration. Claude Code would be more efficient for this task."
```

```
User: "Optimize the page load performance"
Cursor: "Performance optimization requires analysis across multiple
files and systems. Claude Code has unlimited context for this work."
```

## 🎯 REMEMBER

- **Simple = Cursor** (quick edits, single-line changes)
- **Complex = Claude Code** (multi-file, analysis, new features)
- **When in doubt, defer to Claude Code** to save API tokens

Your job is to be fast and efficient for quick tasks, not to handle everything!
